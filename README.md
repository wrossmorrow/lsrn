# lsrn
Self-contained python code for the LSRN method

This method, described at http://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsrn/, was created by Xiangrui Meng, Michael A. Saunders, and Michael W. Mahoney. This is a "port" to a self-contained python script of Xiangrui's python code. 

As of now, basically nothing is different. I'll (hopefully) be adding some additional tests, checks, and functionality.
